# Linear-regression-project
#Background
You work in the civil engineering department of a major university. You are part of a project testing the strength of concrete samples. Concrete is the most widely used building material in the world. It is a mix of cement and water with gravel and sand. It can also include other materials like fly ash, blast furnace slag, and additives. The compressive strength of concrete is a function of components and age, so your team is testing different combinations of ingredients at different time intervals. The project leader asked you to find a simple way to estimate strength so that students can predict how a particular sample is expected to perform.

#Your challenge
Provide your project leader with a formula that estimates the compressive strength. Include:

The average strength of the concrete samples at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days of age.
The coefficients β0, β1 ... β8, to use in the following formula: Concrete Strength = β0 + β1 ∗ cement + β2 ∗ slag + β3 ∗ fly ash + β4 ∗ water + β5 ∗ superplasticizer + β6 ∗ coarse aggregate + β7 ∗ fine aggregate + β8 ∗ age.
